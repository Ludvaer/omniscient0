general issues:
filter digits in a row that are not filtered out yet (probably some sort of knaji links)
check if there are nearly empy translations like archaic: or obsolete: or obs.
; - on end of string
m in kana is not kanned while should be equivalent to n

]I probably need mandatory supply hiragana when use alternative unpopular reading

specific cases:
日々 [hibi] [nichinichi] daily; day after day
# (lost 々)
