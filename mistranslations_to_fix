general issues:
filter digits in a row that are not filtered out yet (probably some sort of knaji links)
check if there are nearly empy translations like archaic: or obsolete: or obs.
; - on end of string
m in kana is not kanned while should be equivalent to n

]I probably need mandatory supply hiragana when use alternative unpopular reading

specific cases:
日々 [hibi] [nichinichi] daily; day after day # (lost 々)
出だす obsolete:   # no real text
please (imperative form of) #pointless description of missing link to kanji
一リットル入り [ichirittoru-iri] ~no holding a liter #stray @ and lost ~no
コmピュウタア # unkaninized m
small; little; tiny; fine; petty; slight #repeats three time ! need to fix repetiotions when seeding
